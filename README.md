This is a digital scientific calculator. I grow tired of wishing fo my physical one when it's nowhere to be found.

## Major Stack Update -- 2025 June 10

I've been going back and forth with myself about the stack for this project since its inception.
I want the polish of TS on the frontend and the performance of C++ on the backend. Therefore, I have
officially made the decision to adjust the stack of the project to be just that:
C++ core + WebAssembly bridge + TS frontend + Vue.

I recognize that this stack update just multiplied the workload I have in front of me for my MVP, but I'm a big proponent of at least making an attempt to use well-suited tools for a job.

Like I don't use my power drill when I assemble furniture despite its use for other things, I think TypeScript can be saved for another backend on different type of project. My C++ Phillips screwdriver should work well here, even though it'll take some extra elbow grease.

## State of Development

I will eventually put together a nice UI for this. For now, I am focused on the low level stuff. For this one, I'm handwriting a shift-reduce parser, lexer, and grammar to govern the calculator. I might do this in a couple phases by starting with with a console app (for ease of debugging) and then altering it to be a little client-side app like I'm imagining. -- DBJ

## Dev's Inspiration & Musings

This project is a real challenge for me. Iâ€™ve long been fascinated by programming languages and compilers, but Iâ€™ve never built a parser from scratch â€” nor have I directly applied automata theory to anything outside of coursework â€¦ until now ðŸ˜….

Lexing and parsing loosely structured user input is turning out to be rough, and Iâ€™ll admit: Iâ€™m nervous about keeping this repository public while I work. Itâ€™s not easy to push past the fear of being judged while still figuring things out. But thatâ€™s part of why Iâ€™m doing this â€” to grow, take risks, and learn deeply.

At its core, this project is driven by love. I love my physical scientific calculator, and the idea of building my own extensible, digital version for the PC really excites me. Even if the final product doesnâ€™t match my vision, Iâ€™m confident that the process itself will be valuable.
Thanks for stopping by. -- DBJ
