# Derivex

This is a digital scientific calculator. I grow tired of wishing fo my physical one when it's nowhere to be found.

The anticipated stack for this project is TS + React + Vite.

# State of Development

I will eventually put together a nice UI for this. For now, I am focused on the low level stuff. For this one, I'm handwriting a shift-reduce parser, lexer, and grammar to govern the calculator. I might do this in a couple phases by starting with with a console app (for ease of debugging) and then altering it to be a little client-side app like I'm imagining. -- DBJ

# A Note From The Dev
This project is a real challenge for me. Iâ€™ve long been fascinated by programming languages and compilers, but Iâ€™ve never built a parser from scratch â€” nor have I directly applied automata theory to anything outside of coursework â€¦ until now ðŸ˜….
Lexing and parsing loosely structured user input is turning out to be rough, and Iâ€™ll admit: Iâ€™m nervous about keeping this repository public while I work. Itâ€™s not easy to push past the fear of being judged while still figuring things out. But thatâ€™s part of why Iâ€™m doing this â€” to grow, take risks, and learn deeply.
At its core, this project is driven by love. I love my physical scientific calculator, and the idea of building my own extensible, digital version for the PC really excites me. Even if the final product doesnâ€™t match my vision, Iâ€™m confident that the process itself will be valuable.
Thanks for stopping by. -- DBJ
