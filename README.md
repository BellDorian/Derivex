# Derivex
This is a digital scientific calculator. I grow tired of wishing fo my physical one when it's nowhere to be found.

The anticipated stack for this project is TS + React + Vite.

# State of Development
I will eventually put together a nice UI for this. For now, I am focused on the low level stuff. For this one, I'm handwriting a shift-reduce parser, lexer, and grammar to govern the calculator. I might do this in a couple phases by starting with with a console app (for ease of debugging) and then altering it to be a little client-side app like I'm imagining. -- DBJ
